 To Do for ROOT I/O for LCIO 
 ===========================


 - dependency structure of libraries:
   liblcio.so should not depend on ROOT libraries !
   -> can we use a dlopen mechanism ala marlin::ProcessorLoader ?
      
   -> for now simply add ROOT libraries ....


 - LCFactory needs to have mechanism to choose either SIO or RIO 
   -> could use default arguments (problem: createLCReader already has one)
