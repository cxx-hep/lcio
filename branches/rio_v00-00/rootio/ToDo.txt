 To Do for ROOT I/O for LCIO 
 ===========================


 - dependency structure of libraries:
   liblcio.so should not depend on ROOT libraries !
   -> can we use a dlopen mechanism a la marlin::ProcessorLoader ?
      
   -> for now simply add ROOT libraries ....


 - LCFactory needs to have mechanism to choose either SIO or RIO 

   -> try to resolve based on filename extension (slcio/rlcio)

   -> implement 'generic decorator' that resolves type at open() ...
 

 - RIOWriter:   write Runheader
